- 👋 Hi, I’m Yuan. I recently graduated from NYU with a BFA in Interactive Media Arts and a minor in Game Design. 
- 👀 I’m interested in working on indie games! Either as a programmer or artist or anything in between.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more C# and trying to incorporate more version control in my workflow.
- 🐭 You can find my portfolio at [yuandan.cool](https://yuandan.cool/), and contact me at yuannpengg@gmail.com.
